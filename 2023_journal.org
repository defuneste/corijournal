GH dashboard of org: https://github.com/orgs/ruralinnovation/dashboard

* Important point to discus with every members:
- what tools do they use?
- what are their data need?
- what are their workflow?
- do they use github in public or not? (need help on that ssh, etc..)

*** R / Rstudio [5/5]
- [x] radian : https://github.com/randy3k/radian

it needed pip3 luckily shipped with Mac

#+begin_src bash
pip3 install -U radian
# to test
# export PATH=$PATH:/Users/blbalbalb/Library/Python/3.9/bin
# radian
vi ~/.zprofile
# add export
# unsure about this one : it map redo=  should check ohmyzsh alias
# echo 'alias r="radian"' >> ~/.zprofile
#+end_src

- [x] task view Spatial
#+begin_src R
install.packages("ctv")
ctv::install.views("Spatial")
# trouble with terra probably because of gdal
# and the fact that I do not have clang I added llvm with homebrew
# but did not setup the path permantly, not better
# then tested:  https://github.com/rspatial/terra
# ttps://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1268
# this could help
#+end_src

- [x] DBI/RpostgreSQL
- [x] tidyverse
  #+begin_src R
install.packages("tidyverse")
# needed colorspace
install.packages("colorspace")
  #+end_src
- [x] some of the fastverse -> see later if project need it

** Meeting with Mark
- Grant: broadband / impact/risk with climate change
- Podcast: https://www.brookings.edu/series/reimagine-rural/
** Meeting with Camden

Project is called *ded* (I guess it is *TED*) (see github repo): it take data as input and produce set of graphics in ~.png~ then they are dropped in google drive for partners

** Meeting with Drew
- start with *coriverse*
- focus on documentation
- slowly help organize/streamline/bring idea

** exploring packages in github
- good read in the wiki of coriverse: https://github.com/ruralinnovation/coriverse/wiki
- relying on gh token and {gh} and I will need to setup it instead of using ssh
- should we build package site for internal package?

* <2023-01-25 Wed>

** setting up MAC round 3
- [x] start with {gh}
  following coriverse works out of the box, added comments to help newcomers
  Still some dependencies to install and could take some time
- [x] git config global :
  I just setup the minimum (name + address for blame) in shell instead of R https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration
** meeting with the team
- question about data product in rmda team web page
- round table
** CORI/RISI meeting
- Paul Yost : https://yostlabs.com/

** Meeting with May
** Build cori utils without any error
- PRed it: some functions/data where not into pkg yml >- added them manually not great
** Meeting with John
- ssh for AWS
- a tour of infrastructure
** random question
- regrid data?

* <2023-01-27 Fri>

** setup a repo with doc with GHA at push on main ?
** Meeting with Betsy
- Should we spend time cleaning/archive some stuff ?
  -> yes but low priority could be done at small meeting
- README.md org

** Check DB size
- [x] quick tour psql
- [x] install pgadmin
** GHA jargon

/worflow/ are triggered when an /event/ occurs.

Workflown can contains /jobs/ (a job contain multiple /steps/),  can be run in sequential order or in parallel.

We can use a /runner/  or a /container/
** Investigate CORI package

53/214 we have:
- R project repos
- API/AWS/Amplify repos -> goal is build API for CORI data
- some boilerplate
- CARTO stuff
- shiny app repo to git -> deploy
- Pipeline with different flavors (DAG, sequential scripts)
- some utilities/infrastructure: ansible .github

* <2023-01-30 Mon>

** GHA jargon

Understand GHA: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions

/events/ a specific activity that trigger a workflow : it can be push to specific branch, PR, cron job, using GH rest API

/steps/ are sequential and depend on each other, inside of the same runner data can be share

/runner/ look like a VM (ubuntu, Windows, MacOS)

*** Envt variable = /context/

It looks like they are named /context/: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts

~${{ XXX }}~ is used to store some envt varaible:

examples:

- ~${{ github.actor }}~ : the username of who triggered the actions

- ~${{ github.event_name }}~ : type of event

- ~${{ job.status }}~ : success/failure

*** YAML

#+begin_src yaml
jobs:
  name_of_job:
    runs-on: VM_of_some-version

#+end_src

*** Pros/Cons using gha
+ no need to "pay"
- dependence on GH
- prob bad idea to save/store data

** SE project

- data can be download from: https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download
- data dictionary: https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bdc-data-downloads-output

  *** Potential Workflow:
1. DL data for one State -> folder
2. Unzip -> Move (maybe)
3. A working solution a bit rude on the memory

   #+begin_src r

var_names <-  c(
    "frn" = "character",
    "provider_id" = "character",
    "brand_name" = "factor",
    "location_id" = "character",
    "technology" = "character",
    "max_advertised_download_speed" = NA,
    "max_advertised_upload_speed" = NA,
    "low_latency" = NA,
    "business_residential_code" = "factor",
    "block_geoid" = "character",
    "h3_res8_id" = "NULL" # skip
)


listes_of_files <- paste0("data/", list.files("data"))

my_csv <- lapply(listes_of_files , read.csv, colClasses = var_names)
result <- do.call(rbind, my_csv)

  #+end_src

4. Export to DB
5. Repeat for each states

Way to improve:
    - export to DB at each ~.csv~
    - instead of loading everything into ~my_csv~  at each step: rbind, then clear
    - using faster importing function (data.table/read_csv) and taking dependencies

6. Setup DB for the data, normalize part of it ?

** Team meeting

- See Campden for SE region ETL and analysis
- Meeting with John/Drew about "form 990"

** CORI repo 2

** DONE bio!

** Form-990

- checked volume of data
- low number errors with a bigger number in 2010
- test with 2019
* <2023-01-31 Tue>

** Bio + headshot

** County population
*** RFC/design doc
context : shiny app that summarize data and produce xls and png
digest by a shiny app

call the database

county level

new release

population is at county level and release

rii_diagnostic.county_diagnostic_variables


** SE is for RWJF
*** Design doc

- seeform 477
- raw

- bloc
  - total of location
  - total of business
*** Better do use SQL

** Meeting with the team

* <2023-02-01 Wed>


** meeting with team

** meeting with Matt Rodgers
- dependencies on sch_layer & sch_source
- can spend an hour to see if stuff can be deleted
- we can go and document pkg

** Pulling FCC data
- putting ~.zip~ into s3

** FCC data
*** S3 -> RDS

*** min two options
- aggregate before importing
- aggregate after

*** Testing psql
 - ~.pgpass~ ?
 - [ ] do some dummy files
 - [ ] create DB first instead

*** Aggregate data at various level:
    - understand what we aggregate
      - do we populate with abs/0 value ?
    - level are:
        - census block
        - county
        - nb ?
** Meeting with John
- store unuse DB into s3
#+begin_src R
# Date: 2023-02-01
# Author: Olivier Leroy
# Goal: produce a csv with all the schema/tables inside of data

# inside pgadmin and in data
# SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables;
# then export
# TODO can be done with R


db <- read.csv("data/data-1675279610721.csv")

db_cori <- db[!db$table_schema %in% c("pg_catalog", "information_schema") ,]

# does our tables are linked to other or not
# select * bring a lot of non intersting columns with same/uniques values
# we do not want them

filter_column <- vector(mode = "logical", length(db_cori))

for(i in 1:length(names(db_cori))){
  filter_column[i] <- ifelse(
    length(
      unique(db_cori[,i])
      ) > 1, TRUE, FALSE
    )
}

db_cori_simple <- db_cori[, filter_column]

write.csv(db_cori_simple, "db_cori.csv")
# TODO later remove row index

# Removed in gsheet the first public schema used by PsotgreSQL extension
# then I did not need the last two columns

#+end_src
* <2023-02-02 Thu>
** Install PostgreSQL/Postgis

- I used the EDB solution, it also offer PostGIS (but not hstore)
  https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/02_installing_postgresql_with_the_graphical_installation_wizard/macos/
- On Mac + oh my zsh you need to add an export in ~/.zprofile~

  #+begin_src bash
export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/15/bin/:PATH"
  #+end_src

** FCC data

- unzip in pipleine or before ?
- use s3 -> rds option? need PostgreSQL extension
- Currently using ~cut~ to ro select columns (Con: Cut will not know if ~,~ is in some text data ...)
- [X] On Mac I will go ~.pgpass~ for the test

#+begin_src bash
echo "host:5432:db:postgres:my_pwd" > ~/.pgpass
sudo chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass
# modifying owner could be needed for olivierleroy
# I created a user olivierleroy in postgres
#sudo chown olivierleroy ~/.pgpass
#also exporting PGPASSFILE could be needed
#+end_src

- [X] setup schema staging on MacOS
  #+begin_src sql
create database data;
-- in data
create schema staging;
-- \dt
  #+end_src
- [X] setup DB+tables / technology
    - setup a v0

- verify unique value for some technology in Ohio
