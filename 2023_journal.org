* Management
- Harvest
- Airtable

* ressources:

GH dashboard of org: https://github.com/orgs/ruralinnovation/dashboard

* Important point to discus with every members:
- what tools do they use?
- what are their data need?
- what are their workflow?
- do they use github in public or not? (need help on that ssh, etc..)

* <2023-01-24 Tue>

** Logging to App 2 [4/4]
- [x] divy
- [x] Slack
- [x] Zoom
- [x] firefox: should have started with it

** installing R&co
*** R / Rstudio [5/5]
- [x] radian : https://github.com/randy3k/radian

it needed pip3 luckily shipped with Mac

#+begin_src bash
pip3 install -U radian
# to test
# export PATH=$PATH:/Users/blbalbalb/Library/Python/3.9/bin
# radian
vi ~/.zprofile
# add export
# unsure about this one : it map redo=  should check ohmyzsh alias
# echo 'alias r="radian"' >> ~/.zprofile
#+end_src

- [x] task view Spatial
#+begin_src R
install.packages("ctv")
ctv::install.views("Spatial")
# trouble with terra probably because of gdal
# and the fact that I do not have clang I added llvm with homebrew
# but did not setup the path permantly, not better
# then tested:  https://github.com/rspatial/terra
# ttps://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1268
# this could help
#+end_src

- [x] DBI/RpostgreSQL
- [x] tidyverse
  #+begin_src R
install.packages("tidyverse")
# needed colorspace
install.packages("colorspace")
  #+end_src
- [x] some of the fastverse -> see later if project need it

** Meeting with Mark
- Grant: broadband / impact/risk with climate change
- Podcast: https://www.brookings.edu/series/reimagine-rural/
** Meeting with Camden

Project is called *ded* (I guess it is *TED*) (see github repo): it take data as input and produce set of graphics in ~.png~ then they are dropped in google drive for partners

** Meeting with Drew
- start with *coriverse*
- focus on documentation
- slowly help organize/streamline/bring idea

** exploring packages in github
- good read in the wiki of coriverse: https://github.com/ruralinnovation/coriverse/wiki
- relying on gh token and {gh} and I will need to setup it instead of using ssh
- should we build package site for internal package?

* <2023-01-25 Wed>

** setting up MAC round 3
- [x] start with {gh}
  following coriverse works out of the box, added comments to help newcomers
  Still some dependencies to install and could take some time
- [x] git config global :
  I just setup the minimum (name + address for blame) in shell instead of R https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration
** meeting with the team
- question about data product in rmda team web page
- round table
** CORI/RISI meeting
- Paul Yost : https://yostlabs.com/
- Sizze (sizze.io)

** Meeting with Camden
- Getting that TED is DED
- Focusing on tools for visualization/mapping
** Meeting with Brittany
- Works with dForm (fork abit ahedad from https://github.com/matthewjrogers/dform)
- Does geocoding on it
- uses the coriverse
- metadata trouble -> maybe a way to simplify that
** Meeting with Matt
- Keeping the vision:
  * transparency/accessibility
  * entrepreneurial spirit
  * Diversity equity and inclusion in team and for who

- "Town and gown" -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_and_gown

* <2023-01-26 Thu>

** Update profiles -> pushing that for later!
- [ ] slack
- [ ] bio/headshot
- [ ] zoom
** Meeting with the team

- How the team use them / connect to them
- Discus a bit some tech debt
** Meeting with Dolley

** Meeting with May
** Build cori utils without any error
- PRed it: some functions/data where not into pkg yml >- added them manually not great
** Meeting with John
- ssh for AWS
- a tour of infrastructure
** random question
- regrid data?

* <2023-01-27 Fri>

** setup a repo with doc with GHA at push on main ?
** Meeting with Betsy
- Should we spend time cleaning/archive some stuff ?
  -> yes but low priority could be done at small meeting
- README.md org

** Check DB size
- [x] quick tour psql
- [x] install pgadmin
** GHA jargon

/worflow/ are triggered when an /event/ occurs.

Workflown can contains /jobs/ (a job contain multiple /steps/),  can be run in sequential order or in parallel.

We can use a /runner/  or a /container/
** Investigate CORI package

53/214 we have:
- R project repos
- API/AWS/Amplify repos -> goal is build API for CORI data
- some boilerplate
- CARTO stuff
- shiny app repo to git -> deploy
- Pipeline with different flavors (DAG, sequential scripts)
- some utilities/infrastructure: ansible .github

* <2023-01-30 Mon>

** GHA jargon

Understand GHA: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions

/events/ a specific activity that trigger a workflow : it can be push to specific branch, PR, cron job, using GH rest API

/steps/ are sequential and depend on each other, inside of the same runner data can be share

/runner/ look like a VM (ubuntu, Windows, MacOS)

*** Envt variable = /context/

It looks like they are named /context/: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts

~${{ XXX }}~ is used to store some envt varaible:

examples:

- ~${{ github.actor }}~ : the username of who triggered the actions

- ~${{ github.event_name }}~ : type of event

- ~${{ job.status }}~ : success/failure

*** YAML

#+begin_src yaml
jobs:
  name_of_job:
    runs-on: VM_of_some-version

#+end_src

*** Pros/Cons using gha
+ no need to "pay"
- dependence on GH
- prob bad idea to save/store data

** SE project

- data can be download from: https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download
- data dictionary: https://us-fcc.app.box.com/v/bdc-data-downloads-output

  *** Potential Workflow:
1. DL data for one State -> folder
2. Unzip -> Move (maybe)
3. A working solution a bit rude on the memory

   #+begin_src r

var_names <-  c(
    "frn" = "character",
    "provider_id" = "character",
    "brand_name" = "factor",
    "location_id" = "character",
    "technology" = "character",
    "max_advertised_download_speed" = NA,
    "max_advertised_upload_speed" = NA,
    "low_latency" = NA,
    "business_residential_code" = "factor",
    "block_geoid" = "character",
    "h3_res8_id" = "NULL" # skip
)


listes_of_files <- paste0("data/", list.files("data"))

my_csv <- lapply(listes_of_files , read.csv, colClasses = var_names)
result <- do.call(rbind, my_csv)

  #+end_src

4. Export to DB
5. Repeat for each states

Way to improve:
    - export to DB at each ~.csv~
    - instead of loading everything into ~my_csv~  at each step: rbind, then clear
    - using faster importing function (data.table/read_csv) and taking dependencies

6. Setup DB for the data, normalize part of it ?

** Team meeting

- See Campden for SE region ETL and analysis
- Meeting with John/Drew about "form 990"

** CORI repo 2

** TODO bio!

** Form-990

- checked volume of data
- low number errors with a bigger number in 2010
- test with 2019
